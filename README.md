# Luigi's Shed
Assigment 3 for IMD3901

What I did for this assignment was create a competitive & collaborative shooter game. The game is based on Luigi's Mansion where the players will be shooting ghosts. In competitive mode the players have 70 seconds to kill as many ghosts as they can before the time runs out. In collaborative mode the players have to kill 30 ghosts in 70 seconds. The controls are pretty simple. On desktop the player can you the mouse (click + drag) to look around and aim at the ghost with the red pointer on screen and click to shoot a ghost. The game is also mobile compatible. The player can look around by physically by moving their phone and tap to shoot. The game lets the players know who joins by adding their user ID to the screen and it disappears when they disconnect.

The players can connect via web sockets and multiple players can join which can be set up using an ngrok server. The regular website can be accessed via localhost:8080 after npm install is run along with npm install websocket followed by node app.js in the terminal.
